# Algorithms and Data Structures
## *This is a repo for the Algorithms and Data Structures (summer course) at the IT-University of Copenhagen*

The course is built around the book Algorithms and Data Structures by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne. The [booksite](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/) has a wealth of information, as well as the Java code (exercises, assignments, examples etc.) and the accompanying standard libraries.
